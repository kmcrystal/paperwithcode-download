## About Our Work
Time-series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) deals with the problem of detecting anomalous timesteps,
by learning "normalities" from the sequence of observations.

Our research starts from the question:

> "Is the concept of normal remain consistent over time?"

In time-series anomaly detection task, we challenge this assumption, and show that the concept of normal changes through time.

We call this problem as the "New Normal Problem," 
with the explicit aim of advocating the need to learn how to adapt to emerging norms rather than clinging to historical ones. 

Our research also highlights the efficacy of our simple adaptation and normalization strategy, emphasizing the importance of adapting rather than persisting in the past.



## About the dataset
All datasets are assumed to be in "data" folder. 

1. **NeurIPS-TS** NeurIPS-TS dataset are created using the principles in https://openreview.net/forum?id=r8IvOsnHchr.
We prepared Univariate/Multivariate dataset, for each data length being 1000.
For data generation, please refer to [univariate_generator](https://github.com/carrtesy/DeepTSAD/blob/master/data/univariate_generator.py), [multivariate_generator](https://github.com/carrtesy/DeepTSAD/blob/master/data/multivariate_generator.py).

SWaT and WADI dataset has two types of data: train (normal) and test (abnormal).
Train set does not contain anomaly set. Test set has anomalies driven by researcher's attack scenarios.
Request via guidelines in the [link](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/).
